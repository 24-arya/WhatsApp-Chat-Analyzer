10/1/21, 00:01 - Abhisekh ECE TMSL: So finally here the moment comes, where I have to leave ECE and get into IT. The college started with some really good peeps like @919674328685, @918337839853, @918442801948, Ritam, Prarthana(couldn't tag them because they left the group). Bunked half of the classes, canceled half of them, learned to play Krunker, Skribbl. 

Then came Second Semester sections got mixed up, got new university roll no, shifted from section B to section A, new faces, new everything. But still got accustomed to all of this. Made some new ones like @918100048467, @917044211867 (A really helpful one, a person whom I can trust blindly), @917408554413(i won't ever forget that mechanical ka final wala viva).

And some panur betas as well @919073719851 @919002114563.

College started with ECE and my meaning for college is ECE. And did lot of things last year, and those will be just memories. And I had best memories with you guys!!

This was my department, and it'll remain to be same.

Adios ECE

10/21/21, 22:00 - Shreya ECE: To ridicule for entertainment, yet never being venomous, *RK Laxman's* cartoons chronicled the life of countless average Indians that never failed to appeal to the common man. His own *Common Man* along with the daily cartoon strip *You Said It* in The Times of India continues to live in our hearts. On his birth anniversary, *Team Eclectica* gives all the creative ink-stained artists, an opportunity to pay a tribute to the maestro through its *Cartoon Comic Strip Making Competition*. Sketch your thoughts, captivate everyone with humor and satire and unveil the latent cartoonist in you.

10/25/21, 19:30 - Mainak ECE: Hello guys.
A few days back, I apologized as we didn't receive the grade card for some "unforseen" reasons.
But now it's time. HEHE
Coordinators have given us a date : 27th  of October, to *snatch* our grade cards and 'coolie' some books from the library.
If you have no issues with this date, please reply "OK with 27" in the UNOFFICIAL GROUP.
But if you have a valid reason, we will talk through with the coordinators.

10/25/21, 19:40 - Mainak ECE: But, there's a sad news for people who are having a crush on any Sec B peep.

But can something be more vague than this text of mine?

11/25/21, 11:11 - Mainak ECE: Like at the end of second semester, everyone submitted the MAR points by following a series of processes, you need to submit this semester as well.

I'll take you through the process once again.
11/25/21, 11:12 - Mainak ECE: INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAR POINTS SUBMISSION

STEP 1: Make photocopies (color photocopy is preferable but greyscale photocopy will also be accepted) of every activity certificate.
STEP 2: Write “Self-attested” and give your signature below it.
STEP 3: Scan each self-attested photocopy and save them as separate .jpeg or .png files. Name each of them with their respective activity number as in the list. For example, Proof of donating blood will be named as ‘12a’, and proof of organizing a blood donation camp will be named as ‘12b’.
STEP 4: Make a photocopy of the first page of the evaluation sheet and fill it with the relevant marks in relevant sections along with your name and signature. Save it as a .jpeg and .png file. 
STEP 5: Now add all the attested photocopy files and the evaluation sheet in a folder.
STEP 6: If you do any of MAR lockdown activity, you have to follow Steps 1-4 and then create a separate folder to add only lockdown activity proofs. Name the folder- Lockdown Activity. For lockdown activity there is a separate evaluation sheet.
STEP 7: Compress the folder(s) into a .zip file and name it with your 11-digit University Roll number. 
STEP 8: Send the .zip file to the CR.

Note: 
1. Don't include MAKAUT WEBINAR certificates.
2. A minimum of 25 MAR points are required in a year, still you can apply for more MAR points.
11/25/21, 11:16 - Mainak ECE: You can upload any creditable certificate.
You can also upload any certificate which you didn't use for first year.
We will be again collecting MAR at the end of 4th sem. 
You can submit less than 25 points now. At the end of fourth sem, submit the remaining required MAR points.

1/5/22, 22:12 - Mainak ECE: Hello there, like most of you who check their emails regularly have noticed that MBN ma'am has sent something related to award, achievement bla bla on the group mail id, I'm here writing to help you out...

AY stands for Academic Year.
So those who have got a/  award/s, in the Academic Year 2020-21 you can ping me to ask if it's valid or not.

As you could already see, "Student members of your department have received highly reputed national/international awards/recognition from state/ central government or any other reputed agencies.", awards are quite some damn shit...

Secondly, special achievement is sounding like something LOWER compared to awards, so if not state level, "PARA" level is accepted down the road as well. I have high hopes that you guys have done something in the first year, like "kichu bal chinrechi". I'm here just to listen to all such emotional and motivating stories. Ping me quick...

For People who didn't get "kichu bal chinrechi", it translates as "kuch toh ukhada hai".

And lastly, we the CRS, have decided to make a special list which we  might not send, but to consider the achievements of all the sweet cuties who found their love of their lives in the Academic year of 2020-21...

Gracias
1/5/22, 22:18 - Mainak ECE: I'm not here for long, 1 hr is he most I'll sit tight//

plz submit proper MAR documents so that you will be qualified. Don't submit any document that you had already submitted in 2nd semester MAR. Plz check maximum limit of submission of any particular activity.

PARAKH unified Portal was launched on 7th January 2022 by Secretary Higher Education, MoE-Government of India, for all AICTE approved institutes. Utilizing the PARAKH, social relevance goals will be identified and corrective measures be taken at appropriate level students and faculty members will improve their knowledge and strength in the field of creativity, reasoning, innovation, decision building in their core technical skills and higher order thinking skill.

It is requested that the Institutes, faculty members and Students will participate in AICTE Student Learning Assessment- (PARAKH) and assign the assessment to the students for their better future and maximum utilization of this unique assessment portal. The registration can be done by institutions and individuals and can take the benefit up to the maximum possible extent.

5/9/22, 15:38 - Shreya ECE: To the naked eye the pale blank paper maybe a trifling sight, but once painted by the skillful hands of a writer with words coming from deep within, their own passion, happiness, sorrow; they can entrap even stone hearts. They sing the stories of a roadside pebble, a forlorn bird or a single wilting rose at the florist's window to which the untrained ear had turned deaf. 
So, disperse these seeds of words into the soil bed of paper, unbound by any constraints of language, and watch them bloom as *Team Eclectica* summons all the writers out there, to congregate and celebrate the craft of writing through our content-writing events: *Bits and pieces*, *Prosimetrum* and *Fabula Torquent*.

2/8/23, 21:07 - Mainak ECE: Aj humko Aditi ma'am aur Ayesha ma'am ne bulaya tha.
Fir humko pucha, "Section A me itna Attendance Kam kyu hai?"
Mene tab bola, "Mujhe nehi pata".

Ma'am ne bola, "Ab kuch kar nehi sakte, sabka Gaurdian call Karo, HOD ne bola hai wo sabke Gaurdian ke sath baat karna chahti hai"
Fir bola, "HOD ko ekbar request karke dekho"

Fir HOD se baat karne Gaye.
HOD ma'am ne bola,"Aj FSP class kitne log kiye?"
Humne bola, "11"
Tab HOD ne bola, "Iske baad bhi tum humko Gaurdian call Na karne ke liye request karoge?"
Uske baad, aur baate Hui.

Finally with the help of Aditi ma'am,
Hod ne bola.
"Abhi Gaurdian call nehi karenge par agar koi theory class nehi karega kisi bhi subject ka, toh wo Lab nehi kar payega.
Agar koi FSP class bhi nehi karta hai, hum CA2 Tak dekhenge, uske baad bhi agar attendance low rehta hai, *Gaurdian call hoga hi* "

Toh. 
Humko is kahani se ye seekh milta hai,
"Hafte ke panch din. subha uthke, naha dhoke, kapre pehenke, college ao"

6/17/23, 11:58 - Mainak ECE: As our Placements are knocking at the door. It is important for you to know the hierarchy of approach.

Most of you have contact numbers of the teachers. It's fine to call them in times of emergency. But we need to stick to certain guidelines to maintain decorum.

So for the last year of your college. Kindly maintain the following rules.

If you have any questions after thoroughly going through the mail, and reading each word, contact the placement crs.

The placement crs will do the due diligence to convey the message to the concerned coordinator. 

If you think that the CR is not the right person to convey your message, then try to visit any concerned coordinator in college physically.

Do note, any concerned coordinator is available for your queries in college hours only.
So, kindly refrain from texting or calling them beyond college hours.


Lastly,
For your last minute panic moments, coordinators are not the right person to contact.
6/17/23, 12:01 - Mainak ECE: Choosing any one of the options might seem to be a significantly mammoth task.
